* Gravimetrics

Here, a full blueprint and implementation compendium for a plant phenotyping system is provided.

** What is a Gravimetrics phenotyping system?

This system is designed to enable the study of mass/weight change over time for a set or sets of plants.

By recording changes in weight at a minute-minute scale, plant behaviours can be accurately described, allowing for sophisticated and informative research to be undertaken.

* What is provided?

While there exists commercial solutions to gravimetric plant phenotyping, none are provided as open-source solutions.

This project was designed and implemented at the National Plant Phenomics Centre in Aberystwyth, Wales, UK. Built from the ground up using widely available parts, allowing for adaption and scaling.

Designs for physical hardware components used, software for hardware interaction, databases and web interfaces are all provided.

* Components

** Hardware Interaction

** System Design Documentation

** Raspberry Pi Setup

** Database Configuration

** Web Interface
